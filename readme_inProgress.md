## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
// Introduction: the project‚Äôs goal and motivation.

## Technologies <a id="technologies"></a>
// Technologies used (short).

During the development of the front-end, we used the following technologies:

* [JavaScript]() - Programming language
* [REACT](https://reactjs.org/) - Front-end JavaScript Library used mainly for Hooks
* [Stomp](https://stomp-js.github.io/stomp-websocket/) - Used for websocket communication with the server
// TODO: include Mantine core library (for tables), include react icons

## High-level Components <a id="high-level-components"></a>
// High-level components: Identify your project‚Äôs 3-5 main components. What is their role?
How are they correlated? Reference the main class, file, or function in the README text
with a link.

## Launch & Development <a id="launch--development"></a>
// Launch & Deployment: Write down the steps a new developer joining your team would
have to take to get started with your application. What commands are required to build and
run your project locally? How can they run the tests? Do you have external dependencies
or a database that needs to be running? How can they do releases?
These are the steps a new developer joining the team would
have to take to get started with the application.

### Prerequisites
As the application is mainly written in JavaScript, downloading [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is needed. All other
dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```

Furthermore, you need to install the libraries used :

* Depending on your existing setup, you might need to install more.

### Commands to build and run the project locally

Start the app with: `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

**We strongly recommend to use Google Chrome in full screen *only*, no matter if you have deployed the app or
are accessing it locally**.

### Tests

Run the tests with: `npm run test`

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### Build

To build the app, run `npm run build` <br>

### Deployment
Deployment to the Google App Engine happens automatically when pushed to main. 

### External dependencies

Both the client and the server have to be running for the application to behave as expected.

### Contributing
If you want to contribute, please contact the authors first. If you want to make changes to or add features, please do so on your own branch first and properly test it before submitting a pull request to the main repository. 

### Releases 
We recommend to follow this [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) and to properly document and comment your release. 

## Illustrations <a id="illustrations"></a>
//Illustrations: In your client repository, briefly describe and illustrate the main user flow(s)
of your interface. How does it work (without going into too much detail)? Feel free to
include a few screenshots of your application.

## Roadmap <a id="roadmap"></a>
//Roadmap: The top 2-3 features that new developers who want to contribute to your project
could add.

## Authors <a id="authors"></a>
//Authors and acknowledgment.
