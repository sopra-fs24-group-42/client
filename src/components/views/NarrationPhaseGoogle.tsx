While the villagers lay in restless slumber, those with hidden agendas rise. Wolves, awaken from your guise and prowl the misty shadows. Choose wisely whom you will visit tonight, for your survival hinges on your cunning. Seer, your time has come to peer beyond the veil. Gaze into the crystal orb and discern the true nature of one among us. Choose wisely, for knowledge is power. Witch, the potions on your shelf glimmer under the moon's pale light. Tonight, you may wield the power to save a life or take one. Consider your choices carefully, for each action reverberates through the shadows. Guardian, your watchful eyes and steady hands protect the innocent. Choose someone to shield from the nightâ€™s malevolent embrace. As the night deepens, let your decisions be guided by stealth and wisdom. Remember, the day will come soon, and with it, the time for reckoning. Close your eyes now, and fate will take its course. Good luck, villagers and creatures of the night. May the dawn find you all"
